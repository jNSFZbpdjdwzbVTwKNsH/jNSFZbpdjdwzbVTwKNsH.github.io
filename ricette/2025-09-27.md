The recipe can be cooked with a variety of ingredients. I guess the important
thing is to have a total of 1kg of the ingredients. 
I suggest this dish, because you can freeze it, and it's straight forward to
warm it up in the microwave maintaining quality.

I love to mix it with little pieces of bread.

## Ingredients

- **Potatoes**
- **Zucchini**
- **Mushrooms**
- **Peppers**
- **Carrots**
- **Eggplan**
- **Pumpkin**
- **Beans**
- **Black Pepper**
- **Olive Oil**
- **Salt**

## Procedure

1. Peal everything
2. Cut it in medium size pieces
3. Boil it for 30 minutes (less with pressure cooker)
4. While boiling add: oil, black pepper and salt, you can add also other spieces
5. Take off the broth, storing it
6. Blend everything
7. Taste and add some water to make the vellutata reach the best density

At the end you can choose to keep the broth to give some taste to pasta, or to
cook some other dish.
