I feel the need for a program that runs services that I tell it to, it should
have the following interface:

```py
def start():
"""
Start the program, and so it runs the list of commands stored in a buff
"""
def add(command: str, timer: Duration):
"""
Add an element to the list of commands to execute, the command is also
stored in a buffer file, in the storage.
It is possible to specify a timer. Every time the timer is completed the command
is executed again.
"""
def remove(command: str):
"""
Remove the element from the list of commands to execute, the command is also
removed from the buffer file, in the storage
"""
def elements(command: str): # list
""" 
Show the list of elements that are running 
"""
def restart():
"""
Quit the program and start it over
"""
def watch_updates():
"""
Checks for updates on the buffer file, whenever it is changes the system
restarts
"""
def store(key: str, value: str):
"""
Store some value in the RAM (hopefully), so that I don't need to create files
that are not meant to last, i.e. the name of the current tmux session
"""
def get(key: str):
"""
Return the value of the last tmux session, if any, otherwise ?
"""
```
