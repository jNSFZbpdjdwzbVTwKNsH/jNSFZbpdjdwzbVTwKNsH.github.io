Today I woke up around 7, I took a shower and I had breakfast.
I also went to the doctor to check my eye. Because I have an infection, i.e.
sty.

After that, I went back to my girlfriend place and we stayed together, I sorted
out her place a little bit and we celebrated her birthday all night long.
I took today off from work, because I feel like I am full of it.
I have also been feeling tired.
Tomorrow I plan to go to the library to work with my colleague again.

Even if I felt tired the whole day, I managed to celebrate my girlfriend's
birthday all night long. I also helped her out to clean the kitchen.

I am worrying a little bit about my thesis: I really don't know what I could do,
I want to write to two professors to get some idea.

I also find out that LinkedIn is very helpful on this regard. You can read about
related work that other people are making and you get inspiration. Today it
happened with the token classifier that I am developing.

Today I woke up around 7, I took a shower and I had breakfast, but my colleague
didn't go to the library and so neither I did.

I warmed up my eye, as I need to do twice a day.
Then I worked in the common kitchen. 
In the night I grabbed a beer in the city center.

I feel like I wasn't too motivated. I've been feeling tired.
