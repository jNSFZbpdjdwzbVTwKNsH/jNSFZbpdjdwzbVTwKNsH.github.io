Today I woke up at 7.30. Around 9 I was heading out to the KU lighthouse.
Basically, it's the University of Copenhagen (KU) club that manages start-up in
the university. It means that there is the club manager that helps you out doing
startup. I met an interesting guy, but I didn't really get what his plan is, I
guess I will reach out to him next week. It's basically a free breakfast and a
reason to go to the library.
Then I've been studying a paper about X-ray crystallography. It's a method to
identify proteins' structures.
