Today I woke up around 7 am. 
At 9 I was at my university, because there is a club that I've been visiting the
past 2 weeks. It's called KU lighthouse. The club helps young students to found
and understand what is the meaning of startup; they also guide young CEOs to
fund raising, early challenges and so on.  
Then, I went to KUB nord and I studied. I had lunch at the library and I went
back to study. Around 17 I went out of the library because there was a party at
the campus. I walked around the stands for about one hour with some friends.
Then I went to SMK because there was a special event, and there was
free entrance. There were reproductions of Michelangelo's statues.
Then, Bambi bought me dinner at Popl Burger. I took a hamburger that was really 
delicious. She took another hamburger way more expensive than mine, but I liked 
mine more.
Finally, we went back home to relax and go to sleep. BTW we ended up eating at
22 and there was still some light, the days are getting very long.
