Yesterday night I went to sleep quite late. Therefore today I woke up around 10.
I took a shower and I had breakfast. Then I went to the beach at the opposite
side of Copenhagen with little Bambi and some friends of her.

Around 4pm I went back home and I cleaned my placed and the clothes. I also 
studied a little bit of Machine Learning B and I listened to a podcast.

I feel like this kind of podcast shows a part of the tech world, I don't like.
I am talking about advertisement.
For example, in this episode the CEOs describes how his company is developing 
agentic AI.

What does agentic mean? It basically means that the LLM decomposes a task in 
sub-tasks and it tackles each sub-task sequentially. 
Notably, each sub-task could be composed by some standard query
(e.g. "elaborate the prompt", "find a solution", "generate the answer", 
"check whether the answer is solving the problem").

The CEO explains that at the company there are only 15 software engineers, and
each of them manages a team of Devis (the agentic ChatGPT they developed).
The host is basically helping out the CEO to sell out the product.
