Today I woke up slowly at 10. I asked to a guy on linkedin to work, in
particular for the company [Gamucatex](https://www.gamucatex.com/).
I also hang out with Bambi's friends, meaning that they came to her place.
I'm also setting down on something, I think I want to found a startup.
I'm going to work on it in my free time at night. It should be more like a
hobby. I want to create a social media for people to connect and join hobbies or
some other activities together. Basically, you know you want to do something,
but you don't know who else wants to do it, so you create somewhat a club on the
app and you hope for somebody else to join it. 
It's basically an app based on the concept of KU lighthouse. I'm still defining
the way the app should work. In the meantime I learnt a little bit how I could
create an app to manage my markdown notes.
