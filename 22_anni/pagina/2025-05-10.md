Today I woke up around 8. I went straight for the shower. Then I had breakfast.
I applied for a student job for the machine learning division on my university.
Then I had lunch. In the afternoon, little Bambi helped me out writing a nice
cover letter for BioLib. I will take it as a model and reference for the cover
letters to come. In particular, I got the sections she wants to be prensent:

1. **Introduction**: who I am and what kind of job I am apply for;
2. **Experience 1**: description of a relevant experience;
3. **Experience 2**: another relevant experience;
4. **Why I am a good fit**: conclusions from experiences + company's praise;
5. **Bye-bye**: thanks for the considerations;

It actually took quite some time to make the cover letter convincing for her.
I am happy, because I got a high quality cover letter I can take inspiration 
from. 

For dinner I ate some iced gyoza from lidl and some fish (branzino), which 
little Bambi cooked for me yesterday.
