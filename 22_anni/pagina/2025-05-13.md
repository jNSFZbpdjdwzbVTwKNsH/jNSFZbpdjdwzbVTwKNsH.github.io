Today I woke up at 7. I got out of bed quite fast. Even though I didn't sleep
much yesterday. I studied until half past midnight, then I had dinner.
I got a shower, and the breakfast. Then I folded the clothes I washed yesterday.
Finally I got to lecture. I followed little about it, but it was super
interesting.
Basically, I learnt that state-of-the-art ML models for protein structures 
works the same as LLMs. There are some key differences between the two models
though:
- LLMs tokenize group of words (usually the word with articles, prepositions and
  maybe adverbs)
- Protein structure models tokenize amino acid (maybe ligands, we're doing
  research).
- LLMs are hard to evaluate, we need humans to evaluate them and the evaluation
  is subjective.
- Theoretically, the result of a protein structure model can be either right or
  wrong. Many times, we don't even know how to see whether it's right or wrong,
  but it's either.

Basically ML for protein structure is a very well defined problem and so it's
easier to evaluate the models.

When the lecture was finished I completed the MLB assignment, I actually only
needed to fill in some comments, and then I submitted it.
Finally, today I started to study the theory of ISB from the ground up (from the
start). I want to have super good notes about the topics of this course. It is
amazing.
