I want to get a certificate of my English level: it should certificate the C1.
In this way I will be able to apply for the Danish university. To be able to
pass the test, I will spend 2h every day learning the language. I will try to
organize my time as the university has thaught me: I will plan the study for the
week. During the week I will study and at the end of the week I will do I little
retrospective of the things I've achieved to improve the learning technique.
Tomorrow I will check how I can take the test: I know I can take it online, in
which case I would take the IELTS. On the other hand, I might be able to get the
certificate for free if the CAL allows me to. The CAL provide the language tests
for free for the students enrolled in the Padua University and I am.
