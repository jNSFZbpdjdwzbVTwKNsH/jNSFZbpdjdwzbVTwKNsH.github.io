title: Comparison of Kernel Methods and Large Language Models in Sentiment Analysis 
category: preview
---

This summary describes the work carried out during a roughly 300-hour internship 
by Carlo Rosso, a student at the University of Padua. 
The project had multiple objectives.

After studying the problem of sentiment analysis and reviewing the related 
scientific literature, I implemented, experimented with, and compared at least 
three state-of-the-art models using the Sentiment Penn Treebank corpus. 
I also documented the implemented models and uploaded them to a git repository 
to ensure the reproducibility of the results.

More specifically, during the internship, I investigated the role of syntactic 
analysis and its compositional properties in understanding semantic phenomena, 
with a particular focus on sentiment analysis.
