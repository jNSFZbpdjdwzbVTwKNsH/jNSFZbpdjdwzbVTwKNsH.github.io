As I wrote before, I chose not to get into a relationship with the friend of
mine, on the opposite of what I've been telling you.  
Since it hurt me not to tell the truth, because I feel like I am not accepting
myself, I want to explain why I come up with the lie.  

I was in Denmark since a couple of weeks, when I dated the first girl on Tinder.
She was a 19 high-schooler, I felt very comfortable with her and she was also
very pretty. She is the only other person I called beautiful in my life.  
We met at 16 and we've been talking until midnight. 
When I wanted to go back home, I asked her if she wanted to join me.
Of course, she told me yes. So she came at my place and we slept together.
The day after at 6 she went back home, to change her clothes, to take a shower
and to go back to school.  
At some point we were kissing, she asked me how many girls I have fucked,
and I've answered earnestly. Then she replied that she didn't want to be my 
second time. I guess she thought I was lying and I was actually a virgin.  
She then made fun of me telling I am a nerdy virgin and so on.
It's not like I care a lot about it, but I feel like my answer could have been a
reason why it did not happen. It surely is not the only reason.  
When you asked me how many girls I have had sex with we already had sex, hence
at that time I did not lie. But I kept things unclear.  
On the other hand, I lied about me having a relationship with my friend, because
of the uneasiness that such girl gave me. She definitely made me lose some
confidence.

Sex might have been something traumatic for me, until I've been discovering it 
again with you.  
I have written something about it on my ipad.

Today I feel like you're very far away, you're unreachable.
I feel like I am unreachable for you. I feel like there is an ocean between the
two of us. As if we were in the opposite side of the galaxy, on two different
galaxies.  
I don't mean to say that I miss you. But I miss you, in the meaning that I would
like you here. I would like for you to hug me. To be kept between your arms. I
would like for you to hug me very tight. So that I can only stay still and
feel your warm.  
I feel like your so far away, without feeling like I miss you, because I want to
be hugged, it doesn't matter who is hugging me. 
It doesn't have to be you in particular. 
Maybe I don't want you to hug me, I just want to be hugged.
On the other hand, I don't want anyone else to hug me.
It's like I would feel nothing if somebody else would hug me.
I want to feel like somebody is hugging me; but if anyone hugs me, it doesn't
count; I would feel nothing. But I am not wishing for your hug.
I also feel sick, I have a sore-throat. I have skipped lunch, I am going to
have dinner. So my throat and my stomach hurt.  
It's like I feel a shell. I feel like my mind wants to avoid these topics.

Today, you feel as distant
an ocean stretching endlessly,
a galaxy spinning far from mine.

I do not say I miss you—
but I miss warmth,
the press of arms holding me steady,
the quiet safety of stillness.

I long for a hug,
yet not from just anyone.
A stranger’s touch feels hollow

I don’t want it to be you,
but I can’t imagine it being anyone else.
Is that too much to ask?

My throat aches,
I skip meals, skip thoughts,
skip the truths my mind avoids.

I am a shell,
thin and fragile,
yet impenetrable to anyone

And still, I dream of warmth,
not yours, not theirs,
but something that makes me whole again,
even as the void echoes within.

---

I long for an embrace,
not from just anyone.
A stranger’s touch is weightless,
unable to anchor me in its shallowness.

It isn’t you I want—
and yet, I can’t imagine it being anyone else.
This paradox twists within me:
to ache and find no solace.

My throat tightens with unspoken truths,
my stomach hollow with longing—
craving something to nourish
this vast, unyielding emptiness.

I feel like a fragile shell,
thin and splintered,
every crack betraying the void
I’ve worked so hard to conceal.

And yet, I dream of warmth,
not yours, nor theirs,
but something greater,
something that fills the chasm,
tearing down every wall.

The void echoes softly,
its song a haunting loneliness.
I do not know what I search for,
only that I search—
a nameless longing,
an aching need.

Is it too much to ask?

Today, you feel as distant  
as an ocean stretching endlessly.  
A galaxy adrift, spinning far from mine,  
your light is faint, cold, unreachable.  

I do not say I miss you—  
I miss the stillness that once held me,  
another's heartbeat  
beating gently near my own.  

I long for a hug,  
yet not from just anyone.  
A stranger’s touch is hollow,  
lacking the consistency to anchor me.  

I don’t want it to be you—  
but I can’t imagine it being anyone else.  
The paradox twists inside me:  
to ache without relief.  

My throat is raw with unsaid truths,  
my stomach hollow from hunger—  
for something that nourishes  
the emptiness within.  

I feel like a shell,  
fragile and thin,  
each crack revealing the void  
I try to seal away.  

And still, I dream of warmth,  
not yours, not theirs,  
but something that fills the chasm,  
that annihilate walls.  

The void echoes within me,  
a haunting song of loneliness.  
I do not know what I seek,  
only that I seek it,  
a nameless need  
aching to be met.  

Is that too much to ask?
