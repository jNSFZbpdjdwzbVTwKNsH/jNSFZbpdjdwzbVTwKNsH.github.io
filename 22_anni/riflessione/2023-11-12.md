The thing I am currently thinking is: don't fuck everything up.  
Keep calm, keep going, don't run! Just keep going as I always have.  
Take a breath when it is needed.  
Ho la sensazione che va tutto molto bene. Ho la sensazione di voler strafare e
ho la sensazione che ogni volta che mi sento come mi sento, then I fuck
something up. Take a breath when I feel like I need it. Take a break when I feel 
like I need it. It is all right and everything is going to keep being all right.  
I've been meeting wonderful people and 
I am loved by wonderful people.
I have been loving wonderful people and
I have had been loved by wonderful people since a long time now.  
I guess I quite love my life as it is and because of how it is. I just think it
is wonderful and breathtaking.
