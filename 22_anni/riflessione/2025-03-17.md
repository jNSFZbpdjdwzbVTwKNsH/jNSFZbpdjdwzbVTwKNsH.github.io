I think the main reason why Bambi left me is because I am boring.
She said I am honest with myself, I have discipline and I am cute. 
But she doesn't like me.  
I think the main problem is that I am boring: there isn't an activity we enjoy
doing together, other than living together. So studying, sleeping and living
together. Also, I've been too available to her.
