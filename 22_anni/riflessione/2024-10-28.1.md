- What did you do yesterday?
- Have you ever tried skydiving?
- You look like in between  an explorer and an angel.  
    I don't know much about angels, but I love curiosity. 
    > I hope you can teach me how to fly
- I love your style.  
    How do you look for clothes?  
    Do you have any online source or something?
- Yo girl!  
    You hot and energetic as Tinker Bell.
    > (Touching Tinker Bell allows one to fly)
    Where did you go in your last trip? 
- Yo,  
    you look very young adn tiny.  
    I like small hands.  
    What is your dream city to live in?
