- The room is at most 23.529 m^2
- It's no bigger than your current
- It's cheaper
- It's as far away from the city center as your current
- If you get a bike, you can move comfortably
- I don't have much money, I can put my part of the deposit and 3 months in
  advance, and we can split the first rent. Since I am going to move effectively
  in July, I am not going to pay may and June. We can split the difference of
  the place: my place is 5000, that one is 5900 or something, hence I can put
  450dkk. Also I can require money for living in such a place as European, I
  can put those money.
- Are you sure you want to move?

Lately I came to think we are gods. I mean, we are able to modify the matter as
we wish. The limits are: our current knowledge, our methods.

In the past, somebody would have used the idea of the unicorn or dragon, to show
that it's not enough to dream about something to make it happen.
In today's world, we don't generate unicorn or dragon, because we think it's
unethical. We know that we could modify the DNA of some animal to obtain such
animals. Maybe a dragon that spits fire out of its mouth would be hard do
generate. But most probably, it would be possible. Basically, as long as we are
able to give a precise description of what we wish to build, we can do it,
somehow. Or we will be able to do it.
