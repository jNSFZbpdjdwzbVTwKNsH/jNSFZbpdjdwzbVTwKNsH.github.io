# Lund Tour

Today I went to Lund with the mates of Integrative Structural Biology. 
In the morning we went to MAXIV, in the afternoon we visited ESS.
MAXIV is a facility that spray x-ray on proteins (and other molecules, also
cells, wood, metals, ...).
ESS is a neutron scattering facility. Basically the same thing with neutrons
instead of x-rays (the difference is actually pretty big). ESS is still under
construction. The MAXIV facility seems to care a lot about design and aesthetic.
The ESS looks more about engineering, standardization and cheap of construction.
These laboratories are enormous and they aim to be automated. Basically, you
should be able to connect to these laboratory from wherever you prefer around
the world.
