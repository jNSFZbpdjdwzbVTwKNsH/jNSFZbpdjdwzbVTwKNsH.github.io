My friend, my brother's girlfriend asked me a question.
I told her I am looking for somebody who motivates me, who encourages me to give
me my best and to be my best version of myself.  

It is nice, but what is the best version of myself?
Well, of course, my best version is built on my view point.
Therefore, I would like somebody who share my idea of myself's best version and
engourages me to reach myself.  
I am well aware we cannot and should never have the same opinion on such idea.
But I hope we can always have something in common of what I think is the best
version of myself and what you think that is.  

I like to think by simmetry, therefore I am curious, do you wish for the same
thing.
Should I tell you how you can improve yourself, on my perspective.
Would you like that much?

Reinforcement learning in minecraft, to make it able to play it.
Already done and might work pretty well.

What about pills? They would definitely make me feel way more calm.
