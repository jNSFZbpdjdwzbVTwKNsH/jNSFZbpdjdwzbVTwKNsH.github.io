I want to write the diary, the blog and the notes more consistently, because I
think that it can give me a super good opportunity to reflect on my life and it
gives insights on what I'm doing and how to improve.  
I keep thinking that this is a bad idea because I would put too much pressure on
me. But I will simply stop if that is the case, or when I feel that is the case.

Give me homework to do for danish, to improve my skills with more consistency.  
I need to do it, I need to improve my skills. I can do it. I need to put it in
my weekly schedule. Which, by the way, I found out I have, somehow, which means,
danish into it!
