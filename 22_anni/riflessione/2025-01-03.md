I begin to think you are like a spy.
Telling me bullship to keep the conversation going.
I began to think you are neither bipolar nor your ex sent you the money way 
before you ask me.
I think that exes might exist, but you are telling me nothing about it.
I feel like the reason you keep telling me these bullshit is because I am not
telling you about my past.

Sometimes I think about hurting you. I thought about two ways to do it:

1. Quitting any contact with you until I see you again. I have to see you again
   because I have your keys. Hence limiting our contacts is possible, avoiding
   never meeting you again.

2. Dating some other girl.

I am thinking about hurting you, because I feel like that's what I need to do to
keep you. It doesn't make sense.
I won't date anybody, for two reason: I don't have the time for it; I don't want
to date somebody to hurt you. If I date somebody, then I should want to date
such a person.  
I am sure these thoughts comes from you saying you repeating being bipolar,
the talks about your ex. Improved by the joke or not about the previous two to
be fake.

Sometimes I think it's a way for you to keep me farther.
Simply put, I doubt myself, hence I open up less and I create some distance
between us.
I am not entirely sure I hate the distance. I feel like it can be comfy.
