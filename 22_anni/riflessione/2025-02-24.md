I want to be consistent, even if I need to pay the prize of being boring.
Boredom is important to display stability. It's probably the biggest signal of
stability.
Today I studied 11 hours, almost straight. I can see the bachelor's helped me a
lot. Coming back home from the library I also thought I miss the people I used
to study with. We used to stay at the "library" until 20.30/21 daily.
Sometimes we used to study until midnight or something.
Today I've been feeling powerful. But I would like to see my little Bambi.
I also did the duolingo's Chinese class, to get the daily fire. 
But I was alone. I felt weird.
Also I've been thinking, I can introduce Chinese in my daily talk, when I need
to use one of the few words I know in Chinese.
