Castelli di neve.
Castelli di carta.
Piramidi di carte.
Sono effimeri e perdiamo di vista il resto.


"""
Snow castles, cards castles, paper pyramids.
They are fleeting and imposing on everything else.
It is step one to design our opinions, ideas, and dreams.
I enjoy building and reflecting on my creations.
Opinions, ideas, and dreams serve as inspirations, models, and guides.
I can never fully visualize the final product.
We exist solely in the present.
Yet, I yearn to see the culmination of my efforts.
"""

Snow castles, card houses, and paper pyramids â€” fleeting creations. 
Building starts by shaping our opinions, ideas and dreams.
I love the process of building and reflecting on the outcome.
My ideas guide me, though the final result remains uncertain.
We live now, and often only glimpse the fruits of our labor.
