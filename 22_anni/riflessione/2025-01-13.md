I want somebody more open-minded than you are.
Since we met, you keep talking shit about Denmark and Dens.
I really don't like it. 
I know it might be cultural shock, but I've never thought bad about Dens, not
even the first months I lived in Denmark, so I really have it hard to relate.
I feel like you have a tendency on concentrating on the bad sides of things.
You tend to see bad, also where there is none.
For example, you once said "houses here are like prison/jail", and I replied
"actually it's quite the opposite".  

I don't want you to say what you don't think. 
Which means that I want you to speak your mind, 
to tell me what you think and what your opinions are.
I also would like you to see different 
and so I would like you to talk different.
Especially, I don't like when you talk bad about somebody or something 
and you don't really think it or you don't mind.
I think it's very tiring to hear somebody complaining.

I have the feeling, your humor in English is complaining, 
and I really much do not like it.
