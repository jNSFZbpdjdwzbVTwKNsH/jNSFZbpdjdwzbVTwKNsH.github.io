I think I miss you more and more as time passes by.
I don't think I miss you too much right now, but I feel like it grows unavoidably.
I miss you hugging me, laying down over me, you feeling me.
I miss touching you, feeling you and feeling you feeling me.
I miss your compassion; 
I miss you warmth and your laziness; 
I miss your patience, your calm and your gentleness.

In the stillness you left behind,  
at first, the ache is slight—  
a faint echo in the place we shared,  
a quiet **wisp** that’s easy to overlook.  

**I miss your body's warmth**  
that lulled my restless mind.  
I miss holding you—  
and being held in return.  

I miss the gentle calm  
you carried through each slow morning.  
The compassionate mercy you brought—  
**an invitation to simply be**.  

I know I’ll see you soon,  
yet every thought of you magnifies the wait.  
I’m reminded how much I miss you,  
**the simple comfort of your presence**.

Wisp remind me the candles, for example when I don't fully switch it off, so the
smoke is produced and I ignore it.  
I miss your body's warmth, in particular you're HOT!
An invitation to simply be meaning that I want to be, most importantly I want
you to be, and to be here. On the converse, not being means being dead or far away.
What I miss the most of you is the simple comfort of your presence, just you
being here. So that I can touch, hear, play and fuck with you.
