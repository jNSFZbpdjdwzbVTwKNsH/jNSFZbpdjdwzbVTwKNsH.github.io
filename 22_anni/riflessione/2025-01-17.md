I feel like I am hurting you as when you were trying to bite me and I kept you
away with my arm.  
It is something I didn't tell you yet. When I think about the time I kept you
away with my arm, I feel like I am crying inside. It was something I didn't have
to do. Absolutely. I don't want to say sorry to much, because I already told you
that I would behave bad in these days.  
It's not a justification, like telling you, it's just that I have it very hard
to control my instinct at this moment. I just close in myself and I isolate
myself, for some reason. I hibernate, kinda.  
But when I think about you, I still think you're sooo cuuute. You baby girl.
