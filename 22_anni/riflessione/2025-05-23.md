Complaining is a way to notify a problem. It can be very direct and
straightforward, or else it can be implicit, maybe even passive-aggressive.

I had been think until recently, that I didn't want to live in an environment
with people who complain, because when you focus on the downside, you dive deep 
into it.

I now realize that such a thought is detrimental. It ignores problems, when 
they are present. It diminishes self-reflection. It also leads to a much bigger 
amount of stress, because something at the very least annoys you, but you 
aren't willing to accept it.

Complaining also helps people open up, socialize and connect.
When people have been through the same problems, they feel more similar.
When they are having the same problem, they can rely on each other to solve it.
Somebody can also help you out solve a problem that they went through in the
first place.

Avoiding complaining keeps the problem unsolved, and it accumulates dead weight.
