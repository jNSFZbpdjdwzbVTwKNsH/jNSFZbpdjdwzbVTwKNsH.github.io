I'm thinking about writing to Estina and inviting her over to have dinner 
together.
I think I haven't moved on, because I've come up with the idea and I don't
think it's all that pushie. I mean we haven't talk since quite some time. I am a
little on the edge about this, I don't know which side it is better for me to 
fall on.
